## Tutorial

A third-party encapsulation of Weixin(Wechat) Media Publicity / Service / Enterprise Account APIs. Gradually growing from only one simple pay feature to a large crowd of APIs. ("ㅍ‿ㅍ)

Usage is like:

    WxpayFactory factory = WxpayFactory.getDefaultInstance();

    UnifiedOrder order = ((UnifiedOrder)factory.instantiate(UnifiedOrder.class))
      .setBody          ("买买买!"                                            )
      .setTotalFee      (10970                                                )
      .setOpenid        ("oKKrIt0yPJ2OdoDZrrfORxWEnr0s"                       )
      .setOutTradeNo    ("wxpay-demopay-"+Long.toString(new Date().getTime()) )
      .setSpbillCreateIp(httpServletRequest.getRemoteAddr()                   )
      .setTradeType     (TradeType.JSAPI                                      )
      .build()
      .sign();

    UnifiedOrderResponse orderResp = order.execute();

As this example shows, this SDK is simple, stale, and not easy to use. Think before loving it.
